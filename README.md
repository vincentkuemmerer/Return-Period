# Return-Period

The matlab (R.2023b) function 'RPcalc.m' can be used to calculate return periods of extreme significant wave heights based on an Extreme Value Dataset derived from storms identified using the function available at https://github.com/vincentkuemmerer/CoastalStorm

An example with wave data from the Outer Hebrides is provided, including matlab functions for calculating the extremal index and run length of a wave height timeseries.

For questions and information not included in the function contact me: vkuemmerer@ualg.pt
